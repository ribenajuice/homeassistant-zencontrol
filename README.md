# zencontrol for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant custom integration for **zencontrol** Application Controllers, using the TPI Advanced protocol over UDP/TCP.

Developed and maintained by **[Lumen Resources](https://www.lumenresources.com.au)**.

---

## Requirements

- A zencontrol Application Controller (any model) on your local network
- The **TPI Advanced licence** enabled on the controller (contact your zencontrol installer or Lumen Resources if unsure)
- Home Assistant 2024.1 or later

---

## Installation

### Option A — HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant sidebar.
2. Go to **Integrations → Custom repositories**.
3. Add the URL of this repository and select **Integration** as the category.
4. Search for **zencontrol** and click **Download**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Option B — Manual

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `custom_components/zencontrol` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.  
   The result should be: `config/custom_components/zencontrol/__init__.py`
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

### Adding a controller

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **zencontrol**.
3. Enter the **IP address** of your zencontrol controller.  
   Leave the port at the default (`5108`) unless your installer changed it.
4. Home Assistant will connect to the controller and display its name for confirmation.
5. Choose your **event transport**:
   - **Unicast** (default, recommended) — the controller sends live state updates directly to Home Assistant. Works across VLANs and in Docker environments.
   - **Multicast** — the controller broadcasts updates to the local network. Only use this if unicast does not work in your network setup.
6. Click **Submit**. Home Assistant will discover all devices and create entities automatically.

### Multiple controllers

Repeat the setup process for each controller. Each controller appears as a separate device in Home Assistant with its own set of entities.

---

## Entities created

After setup, the integration creates the following entities for each controller:

| Entity type | What it represents | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Light** (group) | A DALI lighting group | Auto-discovered from the controller |
| **Light** (short address) | An individual DALI fixture | Auto-discovered |
| **Switch** | A DALI relay output | Auto-discovered; detected by device type |
| **Select** | Active controller profile | Shows and controls the current profile |

### Colour control

Colour-capable fixtures are fully supported:

- **Tuneable white (Tc)** — adjust colour temperature in Kelvin
- **RGB / RGBW** — full colour control including a dedicated white channel
- **CIE XY** — precise colour point control

The correct colour mode is detected automatically for each fixture.

### Brightness

All lights support brightness control. Transitions are also supported — set a transition time in seconds when calling the `light.turn_on` service.

## Options — configuring scenes

Scenes let you trigger a specific DALI scene on a group or individual fixture from Home Assistant automations and dashboards.

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**.
2. Find your zencontrol controller and click **Configure**.
3. Select **Add a scene**.
4. Choose the target type (**Group** or **Short Address**) and enter the target number.
5. Enter the **scene number** (0–12).
6. Optionally enter a display name. If left blank, the name is fetched automatically from the controller.
7. Click **Submit**, then **Save and finish**.

A `scene` entity will appear in Home Assistant. Activating it recalls the scene on the target device.

To remove a scene, return to **Configure** and select **Remove a scene**.

## Live state updates

The integration receives live state updates from the controller via push events — no polling is needed. The following events are handled automatically:

- Light level changes (from wall switches, automations, or other sources)
- Colour changes
- Scene activations
- Profile changes

The controller is pinged every 30 seconds to confirm events are still flowing. If the controller has rebooted, event delivery is re-established automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The integration fails to set up

- Confirm the controller's IP address is correct and reachable from the Home Assistant host.
- Confirm the **TPI Advanced licence** is enabled on the controller. The integration will not connect without it.
- Check that port **5108** is not blocked by a firewall between Home Assistant and the controller.

### Entities do not appear

- Wait up to 60 seconds after setup — the integration waits for the controller to finish its startup sequence before discovering devices.
- Check the Home Assistant logs (**Settings → System → Logs**) for any errors from the `zencontrol` integration.

### State updates are delayed or not working

- If using unicast (default), ensure there is no firewall blocking inbound UDP on port **6970** to the Home Assistant host.
- If Home Assistant runs in Docker, ensure the container's UDP port 6970 is mapped to the host.
- Try switching to **Multicast** in the integration options if unicast is not viable in your network.

### Light icons do not update immediately

State is updated optimistically as soon as a command is sent, and confirmed by the controller's push event shortly after. If the icon does not update at all, check that the controller is reachable and events are flowing (see above).
